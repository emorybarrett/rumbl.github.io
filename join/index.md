Past and ongoing projects include *Signatures of bovine tuberculosis transmission from whole-genome sequencing and cattle movement networks*, *Phylodynamic models for the intra-species transmission of Mycobacteria* and *Mutational spectra in Mycobacteria*.  MPhil students are also welcome to [contact](/contact) us if they're interested in doing their project with us.

Besides our shared interest in science, the group enjoys an active social life. We have regular dinners and love to explore the restaurants and pubs of Cambridge together. The group take turns in beating the PI at squash, and also play each other and other members of the department.

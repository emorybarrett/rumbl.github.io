"At its best, peer review is a slow and careful evaluation of new research by appropriate experts. It involves multiple rounds of revision that removes errors, strengthens analyses, and noticeably improves manuscripts.

At its worst, it is merely window dressing that gives the unwarranted appearance of authority, a cursory process which confers no real value, enforces orthodoxy, and overlooks both obvious analytical problems and outright fraud entirely.

Regardless of how any individual paper is reviewed – and the experience is usually somewhere between the above extremes – the sad truth is peer review in its entirety is struggling..."

## Course Description:

Scientific publishing relies heavily on peer review, yet formal training in this skill is rare and often inconsistent across labs. At the same time, preprints are reshaping how research is shared in the life sciences - and conference culture in AI/ML complicates this further, often in exciting ways! This course uses preprint servers such as bioRxiv to teach students how to critically and constructively review manuscripts, with a focus on preprints at the intersection of AI and biology.

We have modeled this class (and previous [versions](/courses/)) after on [a course at NYU](http://bhabhaekiertlab.org/teaching) organized by Gira Bhabha, Damian Ekiert, Liam Holt & Timothee Lionnet.

## Racism and Bias in Peer review

We idealize peer review process as an unbiased assessment of science. But bias creeps in to all aspects of evaluation, especially if the evaluators are not willing to acknowledge their own potential biases. These biases accumulate and manifest in harming the careers of scientists from historically marginalized groups.

## Course structure

Students will be paired to serve as "Co-Discussion Leaders" for one BioRxiv/arXiv/ChemRxiv manuscript of their choosing.  The co-discussion leaders will compose one joint written peer review, with a first draft due immediately to us prior to their presentation, reflecting their original thoughts on the manuscript. We ask that you do not use AI tools in preparing the review. For each class, everyone, not just the co-discussion leaders, should be prepared by having the paper carefully. We will start each day by calling on each participant in the class and asking them to share: 1 confusing thing about the paper and 1 cool thing about the paper.

After the round of sharing, the Discussion Leaders will present a joint talk similar in content and quality to a Tetrad or QBC Journal Club presentation, with an estimated 30-40 minute duration (noting that interruptions and discussion may take us closer to an hour).

 After the group discussion, the co-discussion leaders will edit their review to reflect what emerged in the discussion. The deadline for this "final" review is May 15th 5PM. The review will be posted (either named or anonymously through James Fraser acting as an "editor") as comments associated with the preprint on BioRxiv or a Zenodo record.

#### Some good guidelines for reviewing

- Don't be an a$$hole
- Consider that you may have misunderstood something and ask for clarification
- Be constructive
- Have empathy, imagine receiving the review!
- What should be public, what should be private?
- Consider your own biases
- It doesn’t need to be the paper YOU would have written
- Don't be an a$$hole

# Our research
As a group, our fundamental interest is in bacterial evolution, particularly the emergence and transmission of bacterial pathogens. We are interested in how and when novel clones emerge, how they become resistant to antibiotics, how they interact with human and animal hosts, and what are their pathways of transmission. We predominantly use large-scale genomics, phylogenetics and population genomics to address these questions. As we are interested in fundamental processes, we do not limit ourselves to specific organisms, but try to look for similar processes operating in different organisms and different niches.

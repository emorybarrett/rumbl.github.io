## Research Background 

In the future, vehicles will be seamlessly connected—not only to each other but also to infrastructure, pedestrians, and the cloud. This connectivity will allow vehicles to access vast amounts of real-time information, enabling them to make autonomous and cooperative decisions. At this level, vehicles are connected and automated, forming a complex network of mobility. Each vehicle will also be electrified, utilizing multiple power sources for improved energy efficiency. Examples include hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Among these, electric motors will play a crucial role as the core component driving electrified vehicles. 

Control of these connected, automated, and electrified vehicles (CAEVs) involves managing multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) at various levels. At the network level, this includes controlling multiple vehicles and their interactions. At the vehicle level, it involves optimizing the use of multiple power sources. Finally, at the component level, it requires precise control of multiple voltages within electric motors. 

To fully unlock the potential of CAEVs, such as maximizing energy efficiency, optimal control across multiple levels is essential for managing these complex and interconnected degrees of freedom effectively.

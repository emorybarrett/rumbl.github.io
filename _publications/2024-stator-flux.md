abstract: "
  This paper presents a stator flux linkage estimation from the integration result of the stator flux linkage dynamics described in the stationary frame for nonlinear synchronous machines (SMs). The key idea is to estimate the integration error and rotating flux linkages including nonlinearity using the linear state observer and to subtract the estimated integration error from the integration result. The proposed method is validated by MATLAB simulation results obtained using a 35-kW SM drive.

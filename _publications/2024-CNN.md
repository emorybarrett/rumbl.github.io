abstract: "
  This study proposes a **convolutional neural network (CNN)**-based adaptive controller with three notable features: 1) it determines control input directly from **historical sensor data**; 2) it learns the desired control policy during **real-time implementation** without using a **pre-trained** network; and 3) the **asymptotic tracking error convergence** is proven during the learning process. An adaptive law for learning the desired control policy is derived using the **gradient descent** optimization method, and its stability is analyzed based on the **Lyapunov** approach. A simulation study using a control-affine nonlinear system demonstrated that the proposed controller exhibits these features, and its performance can be tuned by manipulating the design parameters. In addition, it is shown that the proposed controller has a superior tracking performance to that of a deep neural network (DNN)-based adaptive controller.

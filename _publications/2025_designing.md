abstract: "
 This paper develops an advanced order reduction technique-based adaptive feedback system for two-wheeled mobile robot (TWMR) trajectory tracking applications, recovering the desired tracking performance in the presence of model-plant mismatches. There exists two major contributions: (a) a proportional-integral (PI)-type filter smoothing the position measurements of the TWMRs to secure a high-quality feedback loop without system model information through the order reduction (OR) technique and (b) the adaptive feedback system includes the PI-type filter to accomplish the trajectory tracking mission of TWMRs with the guarantee of the performance recovery property through the OR technique. MATLAB/Simulink emulates the designed adaptive feedback system to highlight the practical advantages of the proposed technique.

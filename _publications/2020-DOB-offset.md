abstract: "
This paper presents an offset-free global tracking control algorithm for the input-constrained plants modeled as controllable and open-loop strictly stable linear time invariant (LTI) systems. The contribution of this study is two-fold: First, a global tracking control law is devised in such a way that it not only leads to offset-free reference tracking but also handles the input constraints using the invariance property of a projection operator embedded in the proposed disturbance observer (DOB). Second, the offset-free tracking property is guaranteed against uncertainties caused by plant-model mismatch using the DOBâ€™s integral action for the state estimation error. Simulation results are given in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to a DC/DC buck converter.

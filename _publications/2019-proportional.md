abstract: "
This study seeks an advanced sensor fault diagnosis algorithm for DC/DC boost converters governed by nonlinear dynamics with parameter and load uncertainties. The proposed algorithm is designed with a combination of proportional-type state observer and disturbance observer (DOB) without integral actions. The convergence, performance recovery and offset-free properties of the proposed algorithm are derived by analyzing the estimation error dynamics. An optimization process to assign the optimal feedback gain for the state observer is also provided. Finally, a fault diagnosis criteria is introduced to identify the location and type of sensor faults online using normalized residuals. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the suggested technique under variable operating conditions and three types of sensor faults using a prototype 3 kW DC/DC boost converter.

**Background**
<br>
A group of scientists within the Fraser lab have begun a journal club centered around issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice within academia, specifically in the biological sciences.

Our goal is to provide an environment for continued learning, critical discussion, and brainstorming action items that individuals and labs can implement. Our discussions and proposed interventions reflect our own opinions based on our personal identities and lived experiences, and may differ from the identities and experiences of others. We will recap our discussions and proposed action items through a series of blog posts, and encourage readers to directly engage with DEIJ practitioners and their scholarship to improve your environment.

*This blog post will be updated on a monthly basis to include new journal club discussions.*

**April 8th, 2022 – Land Acknowledgments**

**Discussion Leader:** [Roberto Efraín (Robbie) Díaz](/members/#Roberto%20Efraín%20(Robbie)%20Díaz)

**Article:** The limits of settlers’ territorial acknowledgments. Asher L, Curnow J & Davis A (2018) DOI: [10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211)

**Summary:** There has been an increase in the performance of land acknowledgments by non-Indigenous people in non-Indigenous, primarily academic settler, spaces. This article examines what purpose do these land acknowledgments serve, who are they for, and can land acknowledgments performed by settlers be improved to better reflect the original intentions of Indigenous people who created this practice?

**Key Points:**
- Settlers perform land acknowledgments as a means of combating the erasure of Indigenous people.
	- The pedagogical intention has been to combat erasure and force settlers to grapple with our positionality.
- In becoming standardized and mainstream, it is reduced to a “mundane “box-ticking” exercise, easily ignored and void of learning opportunities.”
- Settler moves to innocence are those strategies or positionings that attempt to relieve the settler of feelings of guilt or responsibility without giving up land or power or privilege, without having to change much at all.
- The practice needs to be improved to avoid becoming rote and normalized.

**Open Questions:**
- What pedagogical work do territorial acknowledgments accomplish in settler spaces?
- What do people learn from a territorial acknowledgment and does it serve any decolonial purpose?
- Are territorial acknowledgments productive in disrupting avoidance mechanisms and pushing settlers towards decolonial solidarity?

**Proposed Action Items:**
- Begin including an intentional and well-researched land acknowledgment in your presentations.
- Include specific examples of how settlers can contribute to decolonial efforts.


**May 6th, 2022 – The Minority Tax**

**Discussion Leader:** [Stephanie Wankowicz](/members/#Stephanie%20Wankowicz)

**Articles:**
- Addressing racism through ownership. Dutt, K. DOI: [10.1038/s41561-021-00688-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00688-2)
- Black Scientists Are Not the Door to Diversity. Hayes, CA. DOI: [10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00375](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00375)
- The Burden of Service for Faculty of Color to Achieve Diversity and Inclusion: The Minority Tax. Trejo J. DOI: [10.1091/mbc.E20-08-0567](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E20-08-0567)

**Summary:** Marginalized people are expected to dismantle oppressive systems that actively disenfranchise them, an expectation known as the Minority Tax. How does this tax impact people at different stages of their career, and how do we combat this expectation?

**Key Points:**
- Successful DEIJ work takes teamwork.
- There is a lack of respect for DEIJ work.
	- This is most obvious in the deliberate exclusion of DEI work from traditional metrics of professional progress, such as promotion and funding.
	- Universities are often recognized and praised for the contributions of individuals to DEIJ work.
- There is a lack of support for DEIJ work.
	-	This work is rarely done by an expert. Instead, those with lived experiences are often tasked with developing and implementing DEI efforts. This model results in mixed outcomes while allowing universities to claim they support DEIJ initiatives.

**Open Questions**
- How do we get more people involved in DEIJ work?
- What do you do with people who are not interested in contributing to DEIJ?
- How do we track and reward DEIJ effort among academic personnel?
- How do we evaluate the impact of diversity efforts in academia?
- Is it appropriate for basic scientists to create and lead DEIJ efforts?

**Proposed Action Items:**
- Estimate how much time you are spending on DEIJ work compared to others. Take note of who shows up to meetings, comes up with ideas, and executes those ideas.
- Increase the importance of service work, specifically DEIJ work, in tenure and promotion decisions.
- Provide material resources, such as hiring full-time staff or providing money for consultants, to implement DEIJ projects or initiatives.

**Summary**
STEM graduates require extensive education, and progressively demand more specialized and advanced training. This has some implications for DEI work. One important one is that each educational level has compounding effects on the following ones. The common metaphor of a “STEM pipeline” has been used to capture this idea, where learners who move away from a STEM career trajectory are the leaks. In a DEI context, this means differential leakiness would be important to consider.
Metaphors can be useful by simplifying complex systems and helping us reason about them. That assumes they accurately capture the important dynamics of the system, however. If they don’t they can hinder our thinking. Some have claimed that the pipeline metaphor is such a case, challenging both its accuracy and the helpfulness of the interventions it suggests.

I picked these three papers because they critically evaluate the value and accuracy of the metaphor and suggest policies to achieve the outcomes we want (a diverse and equitable environment) but that might not come directly from thinking about leaks.

-[Cannady et al.] uses longitudinal data on students in the US to see if the metaphor is accurate, and claims it is not.
-[Allen-Ramdial et al.] builds off the inaccuracy of the metaphor and suggests policies that the “pipeline” might not suggest
-[Estrada et al.] is a product of the Joint Working Group on Improving Underrepresented Minorities (URMs) Persistence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), which was convened by NIGMS and HHMI. It is an example of how a large working group can adapt the criticisms of the previous two papers and propose policies to achieve an equitable environment.

As I was picking the papers for our discussion, I also thought about alternative metaphors we might use and whether they would help us think differently. I discovered the article by [Beronda L. Montgomery], which offered a wonderful example of a very different way of thinking about education that would lead us to do different things as a result.

**Key Points:**
- The metaphor may not be accurate: similar numbers of underrepresented minority students and non-underrepresented minority students enter STEM majors, and similar *proportions* remain through undergraduate education.
- The metaphor leads us to think that trajectories are strictly one way (you can't *un*leak), while in fact there is much more fluidity in practice.
- The metaphor focuses our attention on individual failures (the leaks) rather than institutional ones (the pipes).
- There is an important distinction between an institution's *culture*, which is essentially the beliefs, policies, and values that guide behavior, and its *climate*, which is the result of the actual implementation of them. An institution may have an unwelcoming or harmful climate while still having a healthy culture, but the pipeline metaphor focuses our attention on policy rather than implementation.

**Open Questions:**
-Is "STEM" a useful category, or is it too broad?
-What sorts of trajectories do "typical" successful scientists follow? What is the definition of “success” in STEM?
-What differentiates "leaky" institutions from others?
-How can we take the useful features of the pipeline metaphor and avoid the harmful ones?
-How does the overall educational landscape influence DEI efforts at the post-secondary levels and beyond?

**Proposed Action Items:**
We broadly agree with the policies suggested by [Allen-Ramdial et al.] and [Estrada et al.], although they are larger-scale interventions. In particular:

- Engage across institutions. Faculty at minority-serving institutions play essential but often ignored roles in diversifying STEM, and DEI initiatives at research-intensive institutions sometimes only engage with other research-intensive institutions. Programs that connect faculty across institutional boundaries can contribute to diversifying trainee access to career opportunities.

- Focus on aligning culture and climate. Ask how students and trainees feel, and listen to them. A failure of good intentions may be a result of both culture and climate.

- Take faculty involvement in DEI seriously. Effective and long-term DEI efforts are much more useful than broad but shallow activities. Institutions can encourage deep engagement by evaluating faculty DEI work on par with teaching and research.

At an individual level, we found rethinking our metaphors can be a useful exercise. Ask yourself: what sort of environments would I like to create? Are the concepts I deploy sufficient to get there? Are they accurate? Are there alternatives?

**August 19th, 2022 - Peer Review**

**Discussion Leader:** [Roberto Efraín (Robbie) Díaz](/members/#Roberto%20Efraín%20(Robbie)%20Díaz)

**Article:** Unprofessional Peer Reviews Disproportionately Harm Underrepresented Groups in STEM. Silbiger NJ, & Stubler AD (2019) DOI: [10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211)

**Summary**
The authors conducted a broad survey of STEM workers who have submitted first-author publications to study the prevalence and impact of unprofessional reviews (defined here as those either focused on the author or unnecessarily cruel and unconstructive) on the self-evaluation and productivity of recipients. A total of 1,106 responses to the survey were analyzed, along with self-reported identities and impacts on confidence, productivity, and career advancement. The authors also examined the potential compounding effect of intersectional identities during their analysis.

**Key Points**

-The majority of respondents (58%) reported receiving reviews that were unprofessional, with some frankly unacceptable comments included for examples (Figure 1).
-The rate at which they were received did not appear to vary across identity groups, but the impacts on self-evaluation, productivity and career advancement were significantly higher for men of color, white women and women of color, and white non-binary people and non-binary people of color.
-Women of color and non-binary people of color reported the largest effects, emphasizing the relevance of intersectional identities

**Open Questions**

-Is there value in maintaining completely unfiltered reviews, or do editors have a role in removing content?
-Should unprofessional review be a cause for sanctions?
-Should professional review be rewarded? If yes, what mechanisms could do so?
-Would more open review decrease the prevalence of unprofessional review, and if so, what interventions are needed to protect learners from retaliation if they participate in it?
-How might we shift peer review from journal-specific, with the attendant gatekeeping role, to manuscript-specific?

**Proposed Action Items**

-Make public review opt-out for senior scientists. While there still may be legitimate concerns about retaliation and power differentials even for established researchers, we suggest that making reviewers public as the default (with generous provisions to opt out) could decrease abuse.
-Journals and editors should provide clear guidelines for professional conduct and sanction those who fail to abide by them. We believe there is a clear distinction between negative review which is ultimately constructive and comments which deride work based on personal attributes or identities. Review is both a service to the field and a privilege: those who use it to abuse others should not be rewarded with further assignments.
-Recognize quality review. Review, as service, is often undervalued. A mechanism to elicit feedback from editors on the quality of a reviewer's work would maintain anonymity, support and encourage quality review, and discourage cruelty.

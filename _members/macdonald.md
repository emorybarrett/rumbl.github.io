description: "Christian graduated from Arizona State University with degrees in Mathematics and Biochemistry, where he conducted research in the total synthesis of marine natural products with Dr. George Pettit. Afterwards, he attended the University of Michigan for his Ph.D. in Biophysics. In [Dr. Randy Stockbridge's](https://lsa.umich.edu/mcdb/people/faculty/stockbr.html) lab, he studied the evolution and function of a number of membrane protein families.


Outside of lab, he enjoys books, music, being outdoors and/or on a bike, and drinking too much coffee.

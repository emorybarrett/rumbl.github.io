description: "Galenâ€™s research interest lies in using structural biology to tackle problems in protein engineering and drug design. He earned his Ph.D. from the Australian National University, where he worked with [Dr. Colin Jackson](https://chemistry.anu.edu.au/people/academics/prof-colin-jackson) on the structure, function and evolution of insect enzymes that detoxify organophosphate nerve agents.


In the Fraser lab, first as a postdoc and then as a staff scientist, Galen used fragment-based drug discovery to guide the design of new inhibitors of emerging anti-cancer therapeutic targets and lead the high-throughput crystallography component of the [QCRG AVIDD Program](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/qcrgAViDD) to discover new anti-virals. 


He now plays a leading role in the [OpenADMET](https://openadmet.org/) project, which aims to  build open predictive models of safety and toxicity for small molecule drug development."

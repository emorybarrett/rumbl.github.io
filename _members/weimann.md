description: "I'm a research associate in the Molecular Immunity Unit at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the Cambridge Vet School co-supervised by Professor Andres Floto. Before coming to Cambridge, I worked at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research on using machine learning to predict antimicrobial resistance from multi-omics data. In my research I combine the analysis of high-throughput phenotypic and transcriptomic screens of large knockout libraries e.g., using scRNAseq and TraDIS, with bacterial genomics and phylodynamics to learn about the biology of bacterial pathogens. Where I find that appropriate methods are missing, I'm eager to develop novel approaches which has resulted in a method for bacterial trait prediction called Traitar and the pan-genome analysis tool Panaroo. I enjoy the interaction with the wet lab and am always keen to engage in stimulating collaborations around the world.  My current focus is on the frequently drug resistant bacteria *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* a major cause of hospital acquired infections and lung infections in people suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) significantly contributing to mortality and morbidity. My projects are to:

1) Derive a systems level understanding of Pseudomonas behaviour in the CF lungs 

2) Investigate the transmission, spread and pathoadaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa across the globe

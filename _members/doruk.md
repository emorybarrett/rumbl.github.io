description: "Yagmur earned her B.S. and M.S. in Molecular Biology and Genetics from the Izmir Institute of Technology and Koc University, respectively. During her master’s, she studied small molecule modulation of circadian rhythm in [Dr. Halil Kavakli’s lab](https://kavaklilab.ku.edu.tr), which sparked her interest in using chemical tools to correct disrupted signaling networks. She expanded on this interest in [Dr. Alan Ashworth’s lab](https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/profiles/ashworth.alan) at UCSF, where she developed high-throughput screening and cell-based assays for drug discovery projects targeting viral and cancer-related proteins.
  
  Now, as a PhD student in the Fraser Lab, she is interested in structure‑guided drug discovery. She aims to understand how promiscuous proteins recognize small molecules and how to tune that recognition to support more selective drug development.
  
  Outside the lab, she enjoys sailing and windsurfing."
